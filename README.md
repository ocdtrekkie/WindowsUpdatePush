# WindowsUpdatePush
This script doesn't do a whole lot, and is based on Microsoft's own [example script](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wua_sdk/searching--downloading--and-installing-updates) that runs via Windows Script Host. It's intended to be pushed with a remote management tool such as [PDQ Deploy](https://www.pdq.com/pdq-deploy/).
